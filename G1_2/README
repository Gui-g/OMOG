2 = Create BEZIER (5 points = degree 4)

q = go to previous curve
e = go to next curve
r = reset curves
t = show support data (control points, lines)

d = delete point toogle
w = weight mode toogle

if you're on weight mode
d = decrease weight toogle

c = C0
v = G1
b = G2

it always starts creating a NURBS

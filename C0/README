Controls:

click to create point
1 = Create NURBS (max 6 points for performance reasons)
2 = Create BEZIER (5 points = degree 4)

q = go to previous curve
e = go to next curve
r = delete curve (need to have more than 1 created)
t = show support data (control points, lines)

d = delete point toogle
w = weight mode toogle

if you're on weight mode
d = decrease weight toogle

c = C0

there are some issues with handling multiples curves (3+), but as it's not necessary for the project I just put a hard limit on curve number
it always starts creating a NURBS
